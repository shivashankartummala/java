Insert the given array elements into a BST in the given order , without balancing/rebalancing.
And Find the distance between two given nodes in a binary search tree.

[5,6,3,1,2,4]  distance between 2, 4  = > 3 ; distance beween 1,9 => -1; distance between 13, 15 => -1;
[5,6,3,1,2,4,8,7,9] distance between 7,9 =>2 ; distance beween 2, 9 => 6; distance between 8,8 =>0;
